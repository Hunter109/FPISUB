# Fake Product Identification System Using Blockchain (FPISUB)

FPISUB is a blockchain-based system designed to combat counterfeit products in the global market by providing a transparent and secure platform for product authentication and traceability throughout the supply chain.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Leverages the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology (Ethereum, Solidity) to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Product Registration:** Manufacturers can register their products on the blockchain, creating a unique digital identity for each item.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated verification processes through Solidity smart contracts, enabling efficient and reliable product authentication.
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive audit trails for tracking record modifications, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** End-to-end visibility of the product's journey, from manufacturing to distribution, empowering all stakeholders.
- **Consumer Empowerment:** Consumers can easily verify product authenticity using MetaMask and decentralized apps (DApps), fostering trust and confidence in their purchases.

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum Blockchain
- Solidity (Smart Contract Development)
- JavaScript (React, Node.js, Express.js)
- MetaMask (Ethereum Wallet and DApp Integration)
- IPFS (Decentralized File Storage)

## Expected Outcomes

- Reduced circulation of counterfeit products, safeguarding manufacturers' interests and consumer safety.
- Improved supply chain transparency and traceability, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
- Increased consumer confidence in product legitimacy and brand reputation.
- Seamless integration with existing supply chain processes, facilitating widespread adoption.
